      "[1] «Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 | The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 was one of the most catastrophic volcanic eruptions in European history. Historians have learned about the eruption from the eyewitness account of Pliny the Younger, a Roman administrator and poet. It is the namesake for Vesuvian eruptions.»\n",
      "[2] «Monte Nuovo | Monte Nuovo (\"New Mountain\") is a cinder cone volcano within the Campi Flegrei caldera, near Naples, southern Italy. A series of damaging earthquakes and changes in land elevation preceded its only eruption, during the most recent part of the Holocene, which lasted from September 29 to October 6, 1538, when it was formed.»\n",
      "[3] «Naples–Salerno high-speed railway | The Naples–Salerno high-speed railway line (also known in Italian as the Linea a Monte del Vesuvio, meaning the \"line up Mount Vesuvius\") is a link in the Italian high-speed rail network opened in June 2008. The 29 kilometre-long line is one of the new high-speed lines being built to strengthen rail transport system in Italy and in particular freight and passenger transport in Campania. The line is part of Corridor 1 of the European Union's Trans-European high-speed rail network, which connects Berlin and Palermo.»\n",
      "[4] «Mount Vesuvius | Mount Vesuvius ( ; Italian: \"Monte Vesuvio\" ] ; Neapolitan: \"Vesuvio\" ; Latin: \"Mons Vesuvius\" ] ; also \"Vesevus \" or \"Vesaevus \" in some Roman sources) is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about 9 km east of Naples and a short distance from the shore. It is one of several volcanoes which form the Campanian volcanic arc. Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure.»\n",
      "[5] «Italian cruiser Vesuvio | Vesuvio was a protected cruiser of the Italian \"Regia Marina\" (Royal Navy) built in the 1880s. She was the third member of the \"Etna\" class , which included three sister ships. Named for the volcano Mount Vesuvius, the ship's keel was laid down in July 1883. She was launched in March 1886 and was commissioned into the fleet in March 1888. She was armed with a main battery of two 10 in and six 6 in guns, and could steam at a speed of around 17 kn . Her career was relatively uneventful; the only significant action in which she took part was the campaign against the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900. She was stricken from the naval register in May 1911 and sold for scrap in 1915.»\n",

    "1. **随机种子用于控制数据集的洗牌和采样：**\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **候选方案的随机探索：**\n",
    "   - 当 `seed >= 0`，会基于随机洗牌的训练集和随机采样大小构建一个 `BootstrapFewShot` 优化器，然后使用优化器生成对应的程序（`program`）。通过这种方式，系统可以生成多个候选方案（即不同的模型或设置）。\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **逐步筛选和选择最佳方案：**\n",
    "   - 通过 `Evaluate` 类对每个程序进行评估，计算分数（`score`）。\n",
    "   - 维护一个分数列表（`scores`），并实时更新当前最佳方案（`best_program`）。\n",
    "   - 随机探索的本质体现在不同候选方案的随机性，而最终根据评估得分筛选出最优方案。\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **限制和控制随机搜索的范围：**\n",
    "   - 搜索范围通过参数控制，例如 `max_bootstrapped_demos` 限制了随机采样的最大数量，`num_candidate_sets` 限制了候选方案的数量。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 随机搜索逻辑总结：\n",
    "- **输入随机性**：通过随机种子seed控制数据集洗牌和采样大小。\n",
    "- **输出评估**：对每个候选程序进行评估，记录得分并选择最佳方案。\n",
    "- **搜索范围限制**：通过候选数量和采样范围等参数限制搜索空间，避免无序的随机探索。\n",
    "\n",
    "通过这些机制，BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch在BootstrapFewShot的基础上实现了基于随机性的候选模型生成和优化，并使用分数评估进行筛选。"

    "### 优化器：MIPROv2\n",
    "\n",
    "**MIPROv2** 是一个继承自 `Teleprompter` 的类，提供了「自动化 Prompt 与 Few-shot 示例优化」的综合优化。它的核心目标是：给定一个「学生程序 (student program)」、一组训练/验证数据集，以及一个指标函数 (metric)，系统性地搜索并挑选出最优的 Prompt 模板和 Few-shot 示例，从而在验证集上取得尽可能好的分数。\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MIPROv2 的主要功能\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **自动化模式 (auto/light/medium/heavy)**  \n",
    "    MIPROv2 预置了多种「搜索强度」模式，可根据任务规模与资源情况，选择适当的模式来平衡搜索效率与质量。比如：\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **light**：试验次数较少、迭代更快；\n",
    "    - **medium**：适中规模；\n",
    "    - **heavy**：搜索范围更大，适合对精度要求更高、且有一定算力/预算支撑的场景。\n",
    "2. **Few-shot 示例自动引导**  \n",
    "    可通过设置 `max_bootstrapped_demos` 和 `max_labeled_demos`，自动生成多组 few-shot 示例集 (每组包含若干示例)。这些示例可以在 Prompt 中起到良好的引导作用，提高模型在小样本场景下的表现。\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **指令 (instruction) 生成**  \n",
    "    通过一个名为 `GroundedProposer` 的组件，把数据集摘要、程序摘要、few-shot 示例以及一些提示技巧 (tips) 整合在一起，自动生成多条候选指令 (instruction)。这样可以让 Prompt 更好地适配具体任务内容，减少手工编写指令的难度。\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **小批量 (minibatch) 与全量评估结合**  \n",
    "    在数据量较大时，支持先在一个小批量子集上做快速评估，帮助快速淘汰效果不佳的候选组合；然后在关键步骤做全量评估，以得到对整体数据更准确的分数。此策略能在保持评估准确度的同时，减少大规模运算带来的高成本。\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **贝叶斯优化 (Optuna)**  \n",
    "    在多次试验 (trial) 中，MIPROv2 利用 Optuna 的 TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) 采样器对 Prompt 组合进行优化。随着试验轮次增加，搜索会逐渐收敛到全局最优或近似最优的指令与示例配置。\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. **日志与可视化**  \n",
    "    每次 trial 的得分、程序版本(快照)及其对应的指令或 few-shot 组合都被完整记录，方便事后回溯和分析。如果需要查看更多细节或可视化结果，可基于这些日志自行扩展或调试。\n",
    "- 所有优化器的前置条件\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **编写/拥有一个 Student Program**：\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - 这个 Program 是一个可执行的「预测器集合」，比如说一个继承自 `dspy.Program` 或 `Teleprompter` 的对象，其中包含一个或多个 `predictors()`.\n",
    "    - 每个 `predictor` 支持 `.demos` 用于存放 few-shot 示例，以及可以给它设置 instruction、系统prompt等信息。\n",
    "4. **准备数据集**：\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - 至少要有一个 `trainset` (带有输入-输出的示例列表)。\n",
    "    - 至少需要一个验证集 `valset` 来做评估 (可以用户自行传入或让代码自动切分)。\n",
    "    - `trainset` 和 `valset` 里的格式需要和你的 Student Program 适配。\n",
    "5. **定义好评估指标函数**：\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `metric` 返回单次评估的分数，如准确率等\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "-  使用流程\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. 初始化 MIPROv2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 调用 MIPROv2 的构造函数时，**必须**传入 `metric`，其余参数如 `prompt_model`、`task_model`、`max_bootstrapped_demos`、`auto`、`verbose` 等可以根据需要进行配置：\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    mipro = MIPROv2(\n",
    "        metric=your_metric_function,\n",
    "        prompt_model=your_prompt_model,\n",
    "        task_model=your_task_model,\n",
    "        max_bootstrapped_demos=4,\n",
    "        max_labeled_demos=16,\n",
    "        auto=\"medium\",\n",
    "        verbose=True,\n",
    "        # 其他可选参数...\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. 如果你**不**指定 `prompt_model` 与 `task_model`，则会使用全局默认语言模型 `dspy.settings.lm`。\n",
    "3. 如果 `auto` 参数不为 `None`，如 `\"light\"`, `\"medium\"`, 或 `\"heavy\"`，MIPROv2 会根据该模式自动覆盖部分超参数（如 `num_trials`, `val_size` 等），减少手动设置的工作量。\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. 运行 `compile` 方法\n",
    "\n",
    "- 当所有准备就绪后，调用 `mipro.compile(...)` 来启动自动化搜索流程。常见关键参数包括：\n",
    "    1. `student=student_program`: 你定义的 Student Program。\n",
    "    2. `trainset`、`valset`: 分别为训练集和验证集，如果省略 `valset`，代码会自动拆分一部分 `trainset` 作为验证集。\n",
    "    3. `num_trials`: 搜索多少轮，每轮会针对不同指令与 few-shot 示例组合做评估。\n",
    "    4. `minibatch`: 是否开启小批量评估。若 `True`，每轮在验证集的一小部分做快评估，以节省算力；若 `False`，每轮都在完整验证集评估，得到更准确的分数。\n",
    "    5. `requires_permission_to_run`: 若担心语言模型调用成本，可设为 `True` 以在执行前给出预计调用量和费用提示，让你手动确认。\n",
    "\n",
    "一个示例调用可能是：\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "best_program = mipro.compile(\n",
    "    student=MyStudentProgram(),\n",
    "    trainset=train_data,\n",
    "    valset=valid_data,\n",
    "    num_trials=20,\n",
    "    minibatch=True,\n",
    "    minibatch_size=50,\n",
    "    requires_permission_to_run=False\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. 查看搜索结果\n",
    "\n",
    "- `compile` 方法最终会返回一个 **best_program**，其内部包含最优的指令（instructions）、few-shot 示例及相关信息。\n",
    "- 你可能最关心：\n",
    "    1. `best_program.score`: 在验证集上的最佳分数；\n",
    "    2. `best_program.trial_logs`: 以字典形式记录了所有试验 (trial) 的信息，包括选用的指令索引、few-shot 示例索引、评测得分等；\n",
    "    3. `best_program.candidate_programs`: 存放那些通过完整评估的程序版本，及对应分数，可回溯查看；\n",
    "    4. `best_program.mb_candidate_programs`: 若使用小批量评估，则这里会保留小批量评估阶段的所有候选程序及分数。\n",
    "\n",
    "拿到 **best_program** 后，可以将其用于下游推断，也可将里面的指令、few-shot 示例配置迁移到生产环境，或结合 `trial_logs` 进一步分析该搜索过程，为下次迭代提供参考。\n"

    "3. **贝叶斯优化 (Optuna)**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - 在 `_optimize_prompt_parameters` 中，将 `instruction_candidates` 与 `demo_candidates` 进行多轮「采样」和「试验」：\n",
    "        - 每次 trial 都挑选一条 candidate 组合放到 predictor 里，然后在 valset(或minibatch) 上做评估。\n",
    "        - TPE 采样器根据已有 trial 的得分分布，逐渐向高分区域收敛。\n",

    "4. **小批量评估 vs 全量评估**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q2: 如果不想使用 few-shot 示例，只想 zero-shot 怎么办？**  \n",
    "A: 可以将 `max_bootstrapped_demos=0` 与 `max_labeled_demos=0`。这样 `_bootstrap_fewshot_examples` 就会返回 None，实际就进入零样本prompt优化模式。\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3: 我想指定自己的 Teacher 模型去生成 few-shot 示例，该如何做？**  \n",
    "A: 在初始化 MIPROv2 时，将一个自定义的 Teacher 实例或配置传入 `teacher_settings`。然后在 `compile(..., teacher=my_teacher)` 时，MIPROv2 会在 `_bootstrap_fewshot_examples` 阶段使用它来生成示例。\n",
