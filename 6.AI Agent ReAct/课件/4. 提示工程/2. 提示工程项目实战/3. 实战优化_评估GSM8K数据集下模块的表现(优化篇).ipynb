    "## 【实战】评估GSM8K数据集下模块的表现（优化篇）\n",
    "\n",
    "使用 dspy 库，让一个大语言模型 (LLM) 变成一个能解答数学应用题的小天才。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "想象一下，你有一个聪明的学生（大语言模型），我们想评估它做数学题能力并后续准备对它进行优化。\n",
    "\n",
    "* **dspy:**  就像一个家教辅导机构，提供了一套教学方法和工具，让你的教学更高效。\n",
    "* **GSM8K:**  就像一本习题册，里面有很多数学应用题。\n",
    "* **`CoT` (Chain of Thought):** 这是一种教学方法，要求学生在解答问题时，一步步写出解题思路，就像我们平时做数学题时的“思考过程”。\n",
    "* **`trainset, devset`:** 把习题册分成两部分，一部分用来教学生 (trainset)，一部分用来考试 (devset)。\n",
    "* **`evaluate(...)`:**  最后，用考试题来检验学生的学习成果。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "当你已经利用DSPy对系统做出编程与评估后，接下来就可以使用DSPy的优化器（optimizers）来微调你的程序中使用的提示（prompts）或权重（weights）。这一阶段很重要，此时你可能需要从仅有的探索数据集（development set）扩展到建立完整的数据集结构，包括：\n",
    "- **训练集**（trainset）: 用于优化模型参数（提示或权重）的数据。优化器会尝试在训练集上找到最佳的参数配置。\n",
    "- **验证集**（validation set）: 从训练集中分割出的一部分数据，用于在优化过程中选择最佳模型配置（在深度神经网络中这种做法很常见，但在这里的优化中提示与训练/验证比例可以与常规方法不同）。用于在优化过程中监控模型性能，防止过拟合。优化器会在训练集上训练，然后在验证集上评估，选择在验证集上表现最好的参数配置作为最后的优化结果。\n",
    "- **开发集**（devset）: 用于最终评估模型性能的数据。测试集应该与训练集和验证集完全独立，以确保评估结果的客观性。\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://typora-photo1220.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/DataAnalysis/LingYi/20241220112127.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "当开始为优化收集数据时，对于训练集，一般建议至少有30个例子（示例），但是如果可以的话，最好达到300个示例。一些优化器只需要`trainset`；另一些则需要同时提供`trainset`和`valset`。针对提示优化（prompt optimizers）而言，建议你将数据进行一个与常规深度学习截然相反的切分比例：**20%数据用于训练，80%用于验证**。\n",
    "\n",
    " *为什么提示优化器要用 20% 训练，80% 验证，而深度神经网络通常相反？*\n",
    "- 这是因为提示优化通常数据量较小，需要更多的数据来评估模型的泛化能力，防止过拟合到少量训练数据上。深度神经网络通常有大量数据，过拟合风险相对较小，因此可以将更多数据用于训练。\n",
    "- 提示优化关注的是如何构建有效的提示，而不是像深度神经网络那样学习复杂的特征表示。验证集上的表现更能反映提示的质量。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "在进行了最初的几轮优化后，你可能会对结果非常满意，或者取得了很大进展但对最终程序或指标的某些方面不满意。这时，你需要回到第一步（在 DSPy 中编程）并重新审视主要问题。你的任务定义是否清晰？是否需要收集（或在线查找）更多数据？是否需要更新指标？是否需要使用更复杂的优化器？是否需要考虑像 DSPy 断言这样的高级功能？或者，也许最重要的是，是否需要在 DSPy 程序本身中添加更多复杂性或步骤？是否需要按顺序使用多个优化器？\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "迭代开发是关键。DSPy 提供了逐步迭代的工具：你可以迭代数据集本身（不断改进数据），迭代程序结构（拆解步骤，增加模块），迭代对断言与度量的定义，以及迭代你的优化流程来优化复杂的 LM 程序。\n",
    "\n",
    "# DSPy 优化器（以前称为 Teleprompters）\n",
    "\n",
    "**DSPy 优化器**是一种算法，它可以优化提示（prompts）和/或LM权重，从而最大化你定义的评价指标（metrics），例如准确率。\n",
    "\n",
    "即**优化器的核心作用是自动调整程序参数，以提高程序性能。**\n",
    "\n",
    "一个典型的 DSPy 优化器需要三个要素：\n",
    "\n",
    "- **你的 DSPy 程序**。这可能是一个单个模块（例如 `dspy.Predict`）或一个复杂的多模块程序例如一个RAG问答系统、一个Agent等。\n",
    "- **你的评价指标（metric）**。这是一个评估程序输出并为其分配分数（越高越好）的函数。（指标定义了你希望程序达到的目标，例如准确率、召回率、F1 分数等。优化器会根据指标来调整程序参数，使其性能更好）\n",
    "- **一些训练输入**。这可能非常小（即只有 5 或 10 个示例）且不完整（只有程序的输入，没有任何标签）。\n",
    "    -  为什么可以只有输入，没有标签？\n",
    "        - 一些优化器（例如 `BootstrapFewShot`）可以利用无标签数据进行自举学习，生成伪标签来辅助优化。\n",
    "\n",
    "如果你碰巧有很多数据，DSPy 可以利用这些数据。但你也可以从小规模开始并获得很好的结果。\n",
    "\n",
    "**注意：DSPy优化器曾被称为teleprompters，现在正式更名为optimizers。这一变化会在库和文档中逐步体现。\n",
    "\n",
    "## DSPy 优化器调整什么？它是如何调整的？\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy 中的不同优化器将通过以下方式调整程序的质量：**自动合成高质量的few-shot示例**到每个模块的提示中，例如 `dspy.BootstrapRS`[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03714)；为每个提示提出并智能地探索更好的自然语言指令（instructions），例如 `dspy.MIPROv2`[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11695)；**你的模块构建数据集并利用这些数据对底层语言模型（LM）权重进行微调**，例如 `dspy.BootstrapFinetune`[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10930)。\n",
    "\n",
    "即三种主要的优化策略：\n",
    "- **合成少样本示例**: 通过生成一些高质量的示例来构建提示，帮助模型更好地理解任务。\n",
    "- **优化自然语言指令**: 调整提示中的指令，使其更清晰、更准确地指导模型。\n",
    "- **微调 LM 权重**: 使用特定任务的数据来微调模型的参数，使其在该任务上表现更好。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "优化器的组合使用可以进一步提高性能，这也是 DSPy 的一个重要优势。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 当前有哪些可用的 DSPy 优化器？\n",
    "\n",
    "可以通过 `from dspy.teleprompt import *` 访问优化器。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 自动少样本Few-Shot学习\n",
    "\n",
    "这些优化器会自动生成few-shot示例（即在提示中提供的演示样例）并将其加入提示中，从而实现few-shot学习。。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`LabeledFewShot`**: 简单地从提供的带标签的输入和输出数据点构建少样本示例（演示）。需要参数 `k`（提示的示例数量）和 `trainset` 以从中随机选择 `k` 个示例。\n",
    "    - *这个优化器做了什么？\n",
    "        - 别被吓到，它只是简单地从训练集中选择一些示例，并将它们添加到提示中，作为模型的演示。\n",
    "2. **`BootstrapFewShot`**: 使用一个`teacher`模块（默认为你的程序本身）生成完整的演示案例以及训练集中的标注示例。该过程会利用metric来验证示例质量，只保留通过检查的示例。可调节参数包括`max_labeled_demos`（从训练集中选的演示示例数量）和`max_bootstrapped_demos`（由teacher程序自动生成的额外示例数量）。\n",
    "    - 这里的“自举”到底是什么意思？\n",
    "        - “自举”指的是使用模型本身来生成新的示例。`teacher` 模块会根据已有的示例生成新的示例，并使用指标来评估这些示例的质量。\n",
    "3. **`BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch`**: 应用 `BootstrapFewShot` 多次，并在生成的演示中进行随机搜索，并选择优化后的最佳程序。参数与 `BootstrapFewShot` 的参数相同，并添加了 `num_candidate_programs`，它指定了在优化过程中评估的随机程序的数量，包括未编译程序的候选程序、`LabeledFewShot` 优化程序、使用未打乱示例的 `BootstrapFewShot` 编译程序以及使用随机示例集的 `BootstrapFewShot` 编译程序的 `num_candidate_programs`。\n",
    "    -  为什么要进行随机搜索？\n",
    "        - 随机搜索可以帮助找到更好的演示组合，因为 `BootstrapFewShot` 生成的演示可能不是最优的。\n",
    "4. **`KNNFewShot`**: 使用 k 最近邻算法为给定的输入示例查找最近的训练示例演示。然后，这些最近邻演示被用作 BootstrapFewShot 优化过程的训练集。\n",
    "    -  什么是 k 最近邻算法？\n",
    "        - k 最近邻算法是一种基于实例的学习方法，它根据输入示例与训练集中示例的相似度来选择演示。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 自动prompt优化\n",
    "\n",
    "这些优化器为提示生成最佳指令，在 MIPROv2 的情况下，还可以优化少样本演示集。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**`COPRO`**](https://dspy.ai/deep-dive/optimizers/copro): 为每个步骤生成和改进新指令，并使用坐标上升（使用指标函数和 `trainset` 进行爬山）对其进行优化。参数包括 `depth`，它是优化器运行的提示改进迭代次数。\n",
    "    - 什么是坐标上升？\n",
    "        - 坐标上升是一种优化算法，它沿着每个坐标轴依次进行优化，直到收敛。\n",
    "2. [**`MIPROv2`**](https://dspy.ai/deep-dive/optimizers/miprov2): 在每个步骤中生成prompt和few-shot示例。指令生成是数据感知和演示感知的。使用贝叶斯优化在你的模块中有效地搜索生成prompt/demo的空间。\n",
    "    - 什么是贝叶斯优化？\n",
    "        - 贝叶斯优化是一种用于优化黑盒函数的全局优化算法，它使用概率模型来指导搜索过程。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 我应该使用哪个优化器？\n",
    "\n",
    "最终，找到“正确”的优化器和适合你任务的最佳配置需要进行实验。在 DSPy 中取得成功仍然是一个迭代过程 - 在你的任务上获得最佳性能需要你进行探索和迭代。\n",
    "\n",
    "话虽如此，以下是入门的一般指导：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 如果你只有**很少的示例**（大约 10 个），请从 `BootstrapFewShot` 开始。\n",
    "- 如果你有**更多的数据**（50 个示例或更多），请尝试 `BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch`。\n",
    "- 如果你只想进行**指令优化**（即你想保持提示为 0 样本），请使用 [配置为 0 样本优化的 `MIPROv2`](https://dspy.ai/deep-dive/optimizers/miprov2#optimizing-instructions-only-with-miprov2-0-shot)。\n",
    "- 如果你愿意使用更多的推理调用来执行**更长的优化运行**（例如 40 次试验或更多），并且有足够的数据（例如 200 个示例或更多以防止过拟合），那么请尝试 `MIPROv2`。\n",

    "**自举迭代生成演示的流程详解**\n",
    "\n",
    "想象一下，你是一位老师 (teacher)，你想教一个学生 (student) 解决数学应用题。你手里有一堆题目 (trainset)，这些示例中有些可能有答案（标注），但许多可能没有（未标注）。。你的目标是教会学生解题的思路和步骤，而不仅仅是答案。为了达到这个目的，你创建了一套教学方法 (BootstrapFewShot)，这套方法可以概括为以下几个步骤，注意**整个过程没有真正的学生参与，是教师模型自己在“自问自答”**：\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. 初始化： 做好准备工作**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 你首先清点了一下手头的资源，设置了一些规则：\n",
    "    - **最多使用多少个自举的例题 (max_bootstraps_demos):**  你不可能无限地讲解例题，所以需要设定一个上限，即最大自举演示数量。。\n",
    "    - **每个题目最多尝试讲解多少遍 (max_rounds):**  教师模型为每个示例尝试生成成功演示的最大次数。 这是因为教师模型在解题时，不一定每次都能得到正确答案或者说能生成一个高质量的演示。通过设置 max_rounds，可以让教师模型在一个题目上尝试多次，增加了成功的机会。\n",
    "    - **记录讲解成功的题目:**  你需要一个笔记本 (`bootstrapped`) 来记录哪些题目你已经成功地演示了解题步骤。\n",
    "    - **记录每个教学步骤的解题过程 (name2traces):** 你还有一个笔记本，用来记录你在讲解每个题目时，每一步是怎么思考的，用了哪些方法 (predictor)，以及这个步骤的输入和输出。我们把每一步的思考过程称为一个“轨迹”(trace)，这个笔记本就用来收集这些轨迹。\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. 遍历训练集: 挑选题目**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 你开始逐一挑选题目 (example) 给学生讲解。你手里有一本题目集 (trainset)，你需要从头到尾，一道题一道题地过一遍。即该流程遍历 `trainset` 中的每个示例。\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. 多轮迭代: 反复讲解**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 对于每个示例，教师模型会尝试生成一个演示，最多尝试 `max_rounds` 次。这种迭代方法至关重要，因为教师可能不会总是在第一次尝试时就产生高质量的演示。\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. 准备预测器: 为教师设置舞台准备讲解**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 在每一轮讲解之前，你需要做一些准备工作：\n",
    "    - **将预测器的 `demos` 属性缓存起来:**  `demos` 就像是你之前给学生总结的解题技巧和例题。在讲解这道题之前, 你会先把这些技巧和例题暂时放到一边 (缓存起来). 为什么呢？因为你现在要教学生的是这道题的解题思路，而不是让他直接套用之前的例题。\n",
    "    - **并从 `demos` 中移除当前示例:**  你还要确保你选择的例题里面没有当前这道题，不然就成了“循环论证”了。这就好比你在讲解一道题时，不会把这道题本身当作例题来讲。\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. 进行预测: 教师模型生成解决方案 (老师自己尝试解答)**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **“现在你开始正式给学生讲解这道题了 (使用教师模型对当前示例进行预测)。”**  这里是**教师模型自己尝试解答**的部分。教师模型会接收题目（示例的输入），然后根据自己当前的“理解”（模型参数和 `demos`）尝试解答这道题。\n",
    "-   **“你一边讲解，一边在另一个笔记本上记录下你的每一个思考步骤, 也就是所谓的\"轨迹\" (trace)”。**  这个“笔记本”就是 `dspy` 用来记录推理轨迹的地方。教师模型并不是真的在“讲解”，而是**在进行内部的推理计算**。每一步的推理都会被记录下来，包括：\n",
    "    -   `你用了什么方法/思路 (predictor)`：使用了哪个模块进行推理。\n",
    "    -   `这个步骤的已知条件是什么 (inputs)`：输入给这个模块的数据是什么。\n",
    "    -   `你得出了什么中间结论 (outputs)`：这个模块输出的结果是什么。\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. 评估预测结果: 检查答案 (评估老师的结果判断讲解是否有效)**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **“你讲解完一种解法后，需要检查教师模型自己生成的预测结果 (prediction)是否正确。”** \n",
    "-   **“如果你有一个评估标准 (metric): 你会根据这个标准来判断学生的解答是否正确，或者是否足够好 (metric_threshold)。”**  这一步是判断讲解是否有效的关键。\n",
    "    -   **有 `metric` 的情况:** `metric` 函数将教师的输出与预期输出（如果有）进行比较，或根据某些标准评估其质量。例如在 GSM8K 数据集中，评估标准会比较模型生成的答案和标准答案是否一致，则会使用这个标准来评估预测结果的质量。\n",
    "    -   **没有 `metric` 的情况:** 默认情况下，生成的输出被认为是可接受的。\n",
    "    -   **阈值判断:** 如果设置了 `metric_threshold`，则将 `metric` 的输出与此阈值进行比较。如果指标的值达到或超过阈值，则认为生成是成功的。\n",
    "-   **这一步实际上是在再看老师讲解的对不对，对了才保留。\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. 生成候选演示: 记录解题过程 (记录下有效的解题步骤生成候选演示)**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **如果生成被认为是成功的（通过了 `metric` 阈值或默认情况下），** 则使用 `trace`（教师步骤的记录）来创建演示。\n",
    "-   **创建 `dspy.Example` 对象:** `trace` 中的每个步骤都被转换为一个 `dspy.Example` 对象。此对象封装了该特定步骤中使用的预测器、它的输入和输出。\n",
    "    -   `predictor`:  记录了解题步骤中使用的模块。\n",
    "    -   `inputs`: 记录了输入给这个模块的数据。\n",
    "    -   `outputs`: 记录了这个模块输出的结果。\n",
    "-   **“然后把这些卡片按照步骤的顺序装订起来，形成一个完整的解题过程 (demonstration)”。**  这些 `dspy.Example` 对象按照推理的顺序组合起来，就形成了一个完整的演示。\n",
    "-   **“我们把这些卡片称为“候选演示”。”**  之所以称为“候选”，是因为这些演示还需要经过筛选（步骤 9）才能最终被添加到 `demos` 中。\n",
    "-   **`augmented` 标志设置为 `True`，以指示这是一个自举示例，表示这是通过自举的方式得到的, 而不是一开始就有的。重**\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. 筛选候选演示: 挑选精华**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **如果你的讲解过程 (trace) 中, 同一种方法 (predictor) 你记录了好几种不同的解题步骤 (demonstration),** 你就需要从中挑选出你认为最好的一种。\n",
    "    - **例如：** 你在讲解“鸡兔同笼”问题时，对于“假设法”这个步骤，你可能尝试了“假设全是鸡”、“假设全是兔”等不同的假设方法, 并把这些尝试都记录下来了. 这时候，你就需要从中选择一个你认为最容易理解、最有效的解题步骤。\n",
    "    - **怎么选呢？**  `BootstrapFewShot` 使用了一种简单的方法：根据这些解题步骤的内容计算出一个哈希值，然后根据这个哈希值创建一个随机数生成器。这样可以保证每次运行程序时, 对于相同的解题步骤, 都会选择相同的一个. 然后，以 50% 的概率选择除了最后一个步骤之外的其他步骤，以 50% 的概率选择最后一个步骤。这种方法既保证了一定的稳定性, 又引入了一些随机性, 有助于提高演示的多样性.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10.  训练学生 (在 `_train` 中)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   自举过程完成后，使用以下组合训练学生模型：\n",
    "    *   **自举演示:** 教师模型生成的演示。\n",
    "    *   **标注演示（如果有）:** 来自 `trainset` 的具有正确答案的示例。\n",
    "*   学生模型中的预测器将使用这些演示进行更新。在进行上下文学习时，演示会被放入提示中。\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. 迭代改进:  不断优化**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 当你再次讲解同一道题目, 或者类似的题目时，你会参考更新后的解题技巧和例题 (`demos`)。由于 `demos` 中包含了之前几轮迭代中生成的演示，因此你的讲解可能会受到这些演示的影响，从而产生不同的讲解思路和步骤，或者说产生不同的预测结果和不同的推理轨迹。这样，通过不断地迭代, 你讲解的质量就会越来越高, 学生也能学到更多、更好的解题方法, 从而提高解题能力。\n",
    "\n",
    "**总结:**\n",
    "\n",
    "自举迭代生成演示的流程就像是一位老师通过不断地尝试讲解、评估学生的解答、记录解题步骤、总结解题技巧，最终帮助学生掌握解题方法的过程。\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **无标签数据利用:** 老师利用大量的习题 (无标签数据) 进行讲解，并通过记录解题步骤来生成演示。\n",
    "-   **迭代改进:** 通过多轮讲解 (迭代)，老师不断优化自己的讲解方法 (预测)，并更新解题技巧 (demos)，从而提高学生的学习效果。\n",
    "-   **关键:**  这个过程的关键在于，老师能够根据学生的解答情况 (评估预测结果) 来判断自己的讲解是否有效，并记录下有效的解题步骤 (生成候选演示)，最终总结出精华的解题技巧 (更新演示)。\n"

    "    -   通过**不同的随机种子 (seed)** 来控制不同的教学方法。例如，每个种子可以对应不同的：\n",
    "        -   训练集打乱的顺序。\n",
    "        -   每个预测器使用的自举演示的数量 (在 `min_num_samples` 和 `max_num_samples` 之间随机选择)。\n",
    "    -   **`if seed == -3: ... elif seed == -2: ... elif seed == -1: ... else: ...`:**  根据不同的种子值，选择不同的优化策略：\n",
    "        -   **`seed == -3`:**  零样本 (zero-shot) 学习，直接使用学生模型，不进行任何提示优化。\n",
    "        -   **`seed == -2`:**  仅使用已标注的示例，使用 `LabeledFewShot` 优化器。\n",
    "        -   **`seed == -1`:**  使用 `BootstrapFewShot` 优化器，但不打乱训练数据集。\n",

    "3. **多次尝试 (多个候选程序)：**\n",

    "\n",
    "**与 `BootstrapFewShot` 相比，`BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch` 具有以下优势：**\n",

    "-   **更鲁棒:**  不太依赖于特定的超参数设置, 因为它会尝试多种不同的设置.\n",
    "-   **可解释性:**  通过 `candidate_programs` 属性可以了解不同的自举策略对性能的影响.\n",
    "\n",
    "**当然，`BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch` 也有一些缺点：**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **计算成本更高:** 需要生成和评估多个候选程序，计算成本更高。\n",
    "-   **需要更多的超参数调整:**  需要调整更多的超参数, 例如 `num_candidate_programs`、`min_num_samples`、`max_num_samples` 等.\n",
    "\n",
    "`BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch` 是一种更强大但也更复杂的自举方法, 它通过引入随机搜索来提高模型的性能.\n",
    "\n",
    "**超参数变化:**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "`BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch` 引入了一些新的超参数来控制搜索过程, 例如:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "-   `num_candidate_programs`: 要生成的候选程序数量（教学方法）.  \n",
    "-   `stop_at_score`: 搜索过程中提前停止搜索的分数阈值.如果设置得太低，可能会错过更好的候选程序；如果设置得太高，则可能永远无法达到阈值，导致搜索所有候选程序。  \n",
    "-   `min_num_samples` 和 `max_num_samples`: 控制每个 predictor 使用的自举演示数量的范围.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   注意**`num_candidate_programs` 控制的是 `seed` 值大于等于 0 的情况的数量**。如配置 `num_candidate_programs=2`，这意味着 `seed` 将取值 0 和 1，对应于两种不同的随机打乱和示例数量的 `BootstrapFewShot` 配置。\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **除了 `seed` 大于等于 0 的情况，代码还固定地考虑了另外三种情况：**\n",
    "    -   **`seed = -3` (零样本):**  不使用任何提示，直接评估原始模型。\n",
    "    -   **`seed = -2` (仅使用已标注示例):** 使用 `LabeledFewShot` 优化器。\n",
    "    -   **`seed = -1` (未打乱的 `BootstrapFewShot`):** 使用 `BootstrapFewShot` 优化器，但不打乱训练集。\n",
    "\n",
    "-   因此，**总的候选程序数量 = `num_candidate_programs` (对应于 `seed` >= 0 的情况) + 3 (对应于 `seed` 为 -3, -2, -1 的固定情况)**。\n",
    "\n",
    "所以如果`num_candidate_programs` 为 2，所以总的候选程序数量为 2 + 3 = 5。会循环尝试 `seed` 值为 -3, -2, -1, 0, 1，并在最后打印 \"5 candidate programs found.\"有5个候选程序。"
